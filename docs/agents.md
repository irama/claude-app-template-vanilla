# Agents & Commands

This project ships with specialised subagents and slash commands. Use them proactively — don't wait to be asked.

| `/a11y-audit`     | Full accessibility & UX audit — inventories keyboard management, ARIA, tabindex, and UX violations; produces a prioritised upgrade plan. Run this on existing apps before migrating to Radix/shadcn patterns. |

## Quality Gates

- **Any UI task**: complete the mobile/contrast/keyboard checklists in [`docs/accessibility.md`](accessibility.md) before finishing.
- **Any task that adds, changes, or removes user-facing functionality**: update `PROJECT_SPEC.md` to reflect the current state before marking the task complete.
- **Before finishing any task that touches auth, API routes, or data mutation**: run a quick security spot-check using the `security-reviewer` subagent.
- **Any pipeline, ingestion, or transformation task**: use `data-engineer` — verify idempotency and data quality gates before finishing.
- **Run `/review` at the end of significant sessions** to catch debug leftovers, TypeScript errors, and failing tests before committing.
- **Run `/security-check` before the first deploy of a new feature** that handles user data, auth, or payments.
